# Buggy-Movie-Rating-System

The program in `main.py` has some errors that cause it to throw errors and illogical solutions. I have provided a test case in the variable, `sample_movie_data`

At minimum:
1. The `average_rating` of any `Movie` that has no ratings should be `None`.
2. `print_movies_rated_at_least(cutoff)` should return movies with average ratings that are greater than or equal to `cutoff`.

We already covered most of these bugs in class but there are some other bugs I left for you to find and squash.

## Rubric
* Squash bugs covered in class - 70%
* Squash wild bugs - 30%

(Each bug is weighted evenly within its section - i.e. covered in class or not covered in class)

### Good luck!
